# wallpaperdownloader-flake
This is a Nix flake which allows to run (and several other things) [WallpaperDownloader](https://bitbucket.org/eloy_garcia_pca/wallpaperdownloader).


## WallpaperDownloader
**WallpaperDownloader** is a Java based application that allows the user to search for wallpapers in several providers, manage them and set them in the Desktop. For more information, [check out the project](https://bitbucket.org/eloy_garcia_pca/wallpaperdownloader/src/master/).

## Why Nix?
I'm currently learning Nix and NixOS and packaging my application (via flake) to run it on Nix is a challenge to me. So here I am :)
